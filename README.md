# WeathCon - a Weather Dashboard and Currency + Timezone Converter for Travel
Planning a vacation? WeathCon can help you prepare with your destination's weather forecast, currency exchange rate, and timezone conversion.

## About This Repository
This website hosts a dashboard for all your travelling needs. Users can search for weather, currency, and timezone information by simply selecting their departure and destination locations using our dropdowns.</br></br<>

WeathCon presents users with the destination location's current and forecasted weather conditions, the timezone differential between the user's local and destination time, and allows users to convert currency between their departure and destination locations.

### Bonus Features
Users are able to toggle the length of the forecasted weather (five, seven, and fourteen days) using jQuery UI tabs.</br></br>

Users' ten most recent currency conversion enquries are displayed on the page, complete with draggable jQuery UI functionality (note these searches are sadly not suppored by localStorage).</br></br>

Users' last nine location searches are displayed on the bottom of the page, and users are able to load the relevant information for those searches by clicking on the history item.

In addition to Osama's article [here](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-format-number-as-currency-string-in-javascript/)</br></br>

Also, huge thanks to [Erik](https://github.com/CodingErik) for his week-old office hours answer that truly, truly saved this project for me. I might have had to destroy my super-fun overly-convoluted triple-nested API call that I initially asked about, but if I didn't have that in the first place, I'd never have been able to figure out how to get promises to produce the booleans we use for error handling and page redirects.
